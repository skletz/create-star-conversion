ETHZ Shape Classes: a dataset for testing object class detection algorithms
===========================================================================

Version: 1.2


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some object classes, such as mugs and swans, are defined by their shape.
By their nature, they are better represented by contour features
than by image patches or interest points.

This dataset contains images of five diverse shape-based classes,
collected from Flickr and Google Images.
The main challenges it offers are clutter, intra-class shape variability, and scale changes.
We deliberately selected several images where the object comprises only a rather small portion of the image,
and we made an effort to include objects appearing at a wide range of scales.
The objects are mostly unoccluded and are all taken from approximately the same viewpoint (the side).

The dataset has been collected and annotated by Vittorio Ferrari,
and experiments on it first appeared in [1].

In [1] we tackled the challenge of detecting objects in real images
given a single hand-drawn example as 'model'. If you would like to address the same problem,
the hand-drawings are included in this release.
We recommend using all 255 images as test set for every class.
Hence, to search for, e.g. bottles also in images images of mugs, swans, etc., making for a
large negative test set. This is important as it allows to get a reliable value for the incidence of false-positives
generated by the detection algorithm.

In addition to its use in the above context, this dataset is also suited for the conventional setting in which
models are learnt from real images (for example, by splitting the dataset in half training / half testing).
We have released further results in this setting in [2,3,4]. Moreover [3,4] also report experiments
in the setting of [1], i.e. using a single hand-drawn example as a model.



The dataset at a glance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Five classes are covered: apple logos, bottles, giraffes, mugs, swans.
Most images contain a single instance of an object class, while some contain multiple instances.
No image contains instances of different classes.

The following table gives a glance over the dataset.


Class          Number of images     Number of instances

apple logos           40                   44
bottles               48                   55
giraffes              87                   91
mugs                  48                   66
swans                 32                   33

total                255                  289

The dataset also includes one hand-drawing for each class, in the directory 'models'.



Groundtruth bounding-boxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Object bounding boxes are included in files

<image>_<class>.groundtruth

Each line in the file encodes the bounding-box of an instance of <class> in <image>

The coordinates of the bounding-box appear in the following format

top_left_x  top_left_y  bottom_right_x  bottom_right_y



Groundtruth outlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Object outlines for applelogos, bottles, and giraffes are included in files

<image>.mask.<instance>.png

There is a separate file per object instance.

For mugs and swans, the outlines are in files

<image>_<class>_outlines.pgm

All instances are in the same file, and different instances have different greylevels.

We used these outlines were used for evaluation purposes in [3,4]
(they were NOT used during training).


Performance plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The complete detection-rate vs FPPI performance plots for all our works [1,2,3,4], as they appeared in [4],
are included in this release (as well as plots for the Chamfer Matching baseline).

All plots are Matlab figures. We encourage researchers to directly reuse these plots
in their publications, for comparison to our methods. Individual curves can easily be
copy+pasted to other Matlab figures by using the figure editing tools of Matlab.

plots/real-images:
plots in his directory correspond to figure 12 of [4].
The models used for these plots have been trained from a subset of the
ETHZ Shape Classes. The test images are a disjoint subset of thedataset.

plots/hand-drawings:
plots in this directory correspond to figure 17 of [4].
The models used for these plots the hand-drawings from the ETHZ Shape Classes.
The test set are all real images in the ETHZ Shape Classes.

We refer to [4] for details of the meaning of each curve, and for the exact experimental setup.



Edgemaps
~~~~~~~~
In files *_edges.tif, we include edgemaps produced by the excellent Berkeley 'natural boundary detector'.
Using this advanced edge detector instead of the standard Canny, resulted in a significant improvement
in object detection performance. We recommend using these edgemaps.

Sketch-based video search
===

# Color-Sketch-based video search (test-bed)

Directory ./cvsketch contains:

* Color reduction using k-means
* Superpixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling (SEEDS)
* Refinement of superpixels using k-color's

## Dataset
Sun et al. in [Indexing billions of images for sketch-based retrieval](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502281) uses the data set, described by Eitz et. al. They described it in [Sketch-based Image Retrieval: Benchmark and Bag-of-Features Descriptors](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5674030/). The data set can be downloaded from [Benchmark dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/tvcg_benchmark/index.html).
The data set contains hand drawn sketches and for each sketche there are corresponding images.

## Errors
* Not a Doxygen trailing comment: Go to Build Settings and search for Documentation Comments and set as No. Doxygen is just a format, you can skip that for code you are not the owner


## Install OpenCV - Visual Studio 2015

[Tutorial](https://inside.mines.edu/~whoff/courses/EENG510/lectures/other/CompilingOpenCV.pdf) tested with the version 3.3.1; downloaded from Githhub

* Clone OpenCV Repository from [>>GitHub/OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
* Clone OpenCV Contrib Repository from [>>GitHub/OpenCV_Contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)
* Save both to C:/libraries
    * C:/libraries/opencv
    * C:/libraries/opencv_contrib
* Install [>>Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to C:/libraries/python27
* Install [>>Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to C:/libraries/python36
    * Go to C:/libraries/python36 and install numby
* Install [>>CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Open CMake-Gui with administrative rights
    * Source Code: C:/libraries/opencv
    * Build Binaries: C:/libraries/opencv-build

    * Check BUILD_EXAMPLES
    * Press generate
    * Press open project
* Build target "ALL_BUILD" in Debug und Release Mode (This will create all "lib" and "dll" files)
* Build target "INSTALL" for both: Debug and Release (This combines all the lib and dll files into a single "lib" and a single "bin" folder)
* Open C:\libraries\opencv-build\install
* Copy the content of the directory to C:\libraries\opencv331
* Set the system environment variables for development:
    * Create a new System variable "OpenCV_DIR"; value="C:\libraries\opencv331"
    * Add "%OpenCV_DIR%\x64\vc14\bin" to the variable "Path"
* Setting project properties in Visual Studio 2015:
    * Add "$(OpenCV_DIR)\include" to additional include directory (C/C++ -> General)
    * Add "$(OpenCV_DIR)\x64\vc14\lib" to additional library directories (Linker -> General)
    * Add "opencv_ts300d.lib;opencv_world300d.lib" to additional dependencies (Linker -> Input)
    * opencv_core331d.lib
    * opencv_highgui331d.lib

    * opencv_video331d.lib
    * opencv_videoio331d.lib
    * opencv_shape331d.lib
* Disable further security warnings:
    * Preprocessor Definitions add "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" (C/C++ -> Preprocessor)


## Install Boost - Windows
* Download Boost C++ library for Windows >> http://www.boost.org/users/download/; Choose the current version; tested with v1.65
* Extract its content to C:/libraries/boost165
* Open C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\Shortcuts\Developer-Eingabeaufforderung fÃ¼r VS2015.exe
* Go to cd C:/libraries/boost165
* Type bootstrap  >> "Building Boost.Build engine"
* Type .\b2 --build-dir="C:\boost165" toolset=msvc-14.0 --build-type=complete --abbreviate-paths architecture=x86 address-model=64 install -j4 >> Build 64-bit Version for VS 2015 - Important is that the architecture have to be x86
* Set the system environment variables:
    * Create a new System variable "Boost_DIR"; value="C:\libraries\boost165"
    * Add "%Boost_DIR%\lib" to the variable "Path"
* Setting project properties in Visual Studio:
	* Add $(Boost_DIR) to additional include directory (C/C++ -> General)
	* Add $(Boost_DIR)\lib to additional library directories (Linker -> General)

## General Settings
* Add /FS to additional commandline options (C/C++ -> commandline input) (to all projects in the solution-explorer)

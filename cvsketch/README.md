Color-Sketch-based video search
===
Color-Sketch-based video search is a way to sketch scenes in mind with rough color segments and search videos containing this color and shape composition.

The following directory is a test-bed and currently contains:
* Color reduction using k-means
* Superpixels Extracted via Energy-Driven Sampling (SEEDS)
* Refinement of superpixels using k-color's

### Datasets
Sun et al. in [Indexing billions of images for sketch-based retrieval](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502281) uses the data set, described by Eitz et al.; Eitz et al. introduced it in [Sketch-based Image Retrieval: Benchmark and Bag-of-Features Descriptors](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5674030/). The data set can be downloaded from [Benchmark dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/tvcg_benchmark/index.html). It contains hand drawn sketches and for each sketch there are several corresponding images.

Samples to test shapes are available here: [OpenCV Shape Sample Data](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/data/shape_sample)

Sun et al. in [Indexing billions of images for sketch-based retrieval](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502281) uses the data set, described by Eitz et. al. They described it in [Sketch-based Image Retrieval: Benchmark and Bag-of-Features Descriptors](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5674030/). The data set can be downloaded from [Benchmark dataset](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/tvcg_benchmark/index.html).
The data set contains hand drawn sketches and for each sketche there are corresponding images.
